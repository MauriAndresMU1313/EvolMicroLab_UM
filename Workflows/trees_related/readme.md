The `Align_single-copy_genes.sh` and `concat_alignments.py` work together aligning single-copy OGs, concatenating these MSAs afterwards and creating a partition file for this concatenated alignment. These files can be passed to `modeltest-ng` to compute the best evolution models (see `modeltest_reps.job`). `raxml_part_to_nexus.py` converts the output from `modeltest-ng` into a nexus partition file, which can be passed to `iqtree` with with `-p $partition`. The output from `modeltest-ng` is only compatible with `raxml/raxml-ng`.
