This directory contains scripts and notebooks that may be useful.

All the python scripts should work with `python >= 3.6`. Some libraries commonly used are
`pandas` and `ete3`. For plotting scripts, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

All the python scripts include a short help text, so you should see it before use them:

```sh
python script.py -h
```
