# Procedures in Coyhaique

## Installing and using `metawrap` in your session 

The [metaWRAP package](https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP) is a customizable pipeline for binning and bin refinement, with powerful applications in the generation of MAGs (_metagenome-assembled genomes_). The recommended metaWRAP installation uses a combination of preconfigured executables and a supporting conda environment. In order to function, the conda environment must be activated, and the executables floder must be defined in the path. 

In `Coyhaique`, the executables and databases are already present in the folders `/mnt/DATA/metaWRAP/bin` and `/mnt/DATA/metaWRAP/DBs` respectively.
