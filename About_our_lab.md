# About the lab

## Aim

The gut microbiota is currently considered as an additional "organ" among living beings. The microbes that live inside us have co-evolved with us, generating an impact on our health. How did these organisms change to colonize the human being? How have they changed once they have become part of our bodies? What kind of changes has caused some of these native organisms to become relevant to our health?

Starting in the 2019, this lab is searching and studying evolutionary patterns in microbial genomes, with focus on organisms from the gut microbiome. Our strategy is to analyze the properties of genes and genomes from these organisms and compare them with their close relatives that inhabit other environments or, in the case of the study of the human microbiome, with organisms that inhabit other mammals. Our hypothesis is that those microbes inhabiting the human body had to acquire new functions by means of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), whereas they lost many of their original genes associated with lifestyles in other niches.

In order to test our hypothesis, we are analyzing genomes from isolates and MAGs, searching for candidate genes for HGT, as well as searching for gene gain/loss patterns when those genomes are compared with their closest non-microbiome relatives.
